Computer mice also have one or more buttons that you can use to select or 'click' on objects on the screen.

Mice with two buttons, 'left' and 'right', do different things.
If you 'left click' it interacts with the object underneath the arrow (called the 'cursor'). If you left click twice, it will highlight text.
Try it!

If you 'right click', a menu will open underneath the cursor.
Go ahead and try for yourself!

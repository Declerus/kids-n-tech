The display in modern monitors is typically an LCD (Liquid-crystal display) with LED (light-emitting diode (LED)) lighting.
Before the mid 2000s, most monitors used a CRT (cathode-ray tube).

Basically this:
LCD monitors are flat and used in most newer computers.
CRT monitors look like big boxes and used in ost older computers.
